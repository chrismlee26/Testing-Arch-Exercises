You've been hired as a software engineer at a new company. Their previous engineer quit unexpectedly, and left some code that... isn't exactly production-ready.

## TODO
For each of the following 3 exercises, your job is to use the techniques covered in class to locate and find the bug(s). 

**As you debug, write down the steps you take in [debug_log.md](debug_log.md).** You'll submit this as your homework assignment.
