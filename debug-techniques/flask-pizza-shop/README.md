# Flask Pizza Shop

The first exercise is a pizza shop written in Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy. It is partially working - the previous engineer left it in a good enough state that you can see a homepage and a "New Order" page. However, new pizzas aren't being added to the homepage, and customers are waiting at the door to place their orders!

## Usage
To run the code, open a terminal and navigate to the `flask-pizza-shop` folder, then run:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then to run the server:

```
python3 app.py
```
